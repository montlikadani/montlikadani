_What can I see about creating and sharing projects to others? Makes no sense, there will be an alternative (or already exists) which is better than mine. So what I made projects in the past years, is to just increase my experience to make a project for my own purposes without pushing to public. No donation, no good review, nothing. Everyone just thinks about himself "I can do a better one than yours". Over time, it turns out that he doesn't know what was doing, has no experience, and has no idea of the language wrote in. In my opinion it doesn't worth the effort to make a small or even a big project because there are peoples who calls it your project as a trashy made or just uninstalls, because he can not do an issue reporting to the developer. All in all, they're just smart aleck. Think carefully about the project and for whom you want to create it._
